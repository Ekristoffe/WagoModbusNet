[Usage]
Q101: What do I have to do to work with WagoModbusNet code class?
    - Variante1: Add class file "WagoModbusNet.cs" to your project 
    - Variante2: Add a reference to "WagoModbusNet.dll" to project
    - Add namespace "using WagoModbusNet;"
    - Enable network permission for your project 

Q102: What frame work version is required? 
    WagoModbusNet code class utilize net framework version 2.
    You can use it with all frameworks >= version 2.


[Hardware]
Q201: Try to set physical outputs, no error - but nothing happens!
    WAGO Ethernet controller provide a "owner" policy for physical outputs.
    The "owner" could be CoDeSys-Runtime or Fieldbus-Master.
    Every time you download a PLC program the CoDeSys-Runtime becomes "owner" of physical outputs.
    Use tool "WAGO Ethernet Settings" and do "Reset File System", it is the easiest way to assign Modbus-Master as "owner".
    Alternatively you can "Login" with CoDeSys-IDE and perform "Reset(original)".
