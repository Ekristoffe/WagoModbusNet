[Usage]
Q101: What do I have to do to work with WagoModbusNet code class?
    - Variante1: Add class file "WagoModbusNet.cs" to your project 
    - Variante2: Add a refference to "WagoModbusNet.dll" to project
    - Add namespace "using WagoModbusNet;"
    - Enable network permission for your project 

Q102: What frame work version is required? 
    WagoModbusNet code class utilze net framework version 2.

[Hardware]
Q201: Try to set physical outputs, no error - but nothing happens!
    WAGO ethernet controller provide a "owner" policy for physical outputs.
    The "owner" could be CoDeSys-Runtime or Fieldbus-Master.
    Every time you download a PLC program the CoDeSys-Runtime becomes "owner" of physical outputs.
    Use tool "Ethernet-Settings.exe" and "format" and "extract" filesystem is easiest way to assign Modbus-Master as "owner".
    Alternativly you can "Login" with CoDeSys-IDE and perform "Reset(original)".
